<h1>Welcome to plotly!</h1>
<p>When you visit the URL for the scatter_view, you'll see a scatter plot with the following statistics displayed in the title:

    Mean: the mean of the x-values and y-values, rounded to two decimal places
    Mode: the mode of the x-values and y-values
    Median: the median of the x-values and y-values
    Standard Deviation: the standard deviation of the x-values and y-values, rounded to two decimal places
    Coefficient of Correlation: the coefficient of correlation between the x-values and y-values, rounded to two decimal places
    The plot and statistics are generated using the data x=[1, 2, 3] and y=[4, 2, 5] in this example. You can modify the code to use your own data.</p>
